# the definition
@DEFN=A {priority queue} implemented with a {binary tree} having the
following restrictions:
<ul>
<li>The {key} of a {node} is greater than keys of its
{children#child}, i.e., it has the {heap property}.
<li>If the right {subtree} is not empty, the left subtree is not
empty.
<li>If there are both left and right children, the left child's key is
greater than the right child's key. 
</ul>

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={priority queue}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT=
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME={binary tree}, {heap property}
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={leftist tree}, {heap}

# any notes.  these will not be printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=The subtree restriction means that when inserting at a leaf,
the left subtree is always used before the right subtree.  Favoring
the left subtree tends to make the tree taller and thinner.
