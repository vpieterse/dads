@AREA=sort
# the definition
@DEFN=A terribly inefficient {sort} algorithm that repeatedly changes
a random item by a random amount until a sorted {permutation} occurs.
For an array of $n$ elements of $k$ bits each, the expected run time
is $n \times 2<sup>nk</sup>$.

#    These are all comma-separated lists of {cross references}
# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."

Michael Bernard "came up with tacosort while trying to create an
algorithm that is even less efficient than bogosort."

The run time is the same as {exhaustive search}.
