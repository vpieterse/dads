# the definition
@DEFN=The problem of finding the shortest {path} in a {graph} 
from one {vertex} to another.  "Shortest" may be
least number of {edges}, least total weight, etc.
# comma-separated list of pure names

@NOTES=
The problem is to find the weight of the shortest path.
For a map, it is to produce the (shortest) road distance from one city
to another city, not which roads to take.

<p>
A modification to most algorithms finds the shortest path, too.  In
<tt>predecessor[i][j]</tt> save the immediate predecessor of the
shortest path from i to j.  Suppose predecessor[i][j] is k; then the
shortest path ends with $\ldots \rightarrow k \rightarrow j$.  If
predecessor[i][k] is p, the shortest path ends with $\ldots
\rightarrow p \rightarrow k \rightarrow j$.  Continue working
backward until you reach i.
