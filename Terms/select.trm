# the definition
@DEFN=A four-part algorithm to select the k<sup>th</sup> smallest
element of
an {array}.  Part 1) Consider the array as groups of 5 elements;
sort and find the {median} of each group.  2) Use Select 
{recursively#recursion} to find <em>x</em>, the median of the medians.
3) Next {partition} the array around <em>x</em>.  
4) Let $i$ be the
number of elements in the low side of the partition.  If $k \leq
i$, use Select recursively to find the k<sup>th</sup> element
of the low side.  Otherwise Select the k-i<sup>th</sup>
element of the high side.

The number of comparisons to select the $i<sup>th</sup>$ smallest of
$n$ numbers is $n+min(i,n-i)+{o(n)#little-o notation}$ or ${\Theta}(n)$.
