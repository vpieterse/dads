# the definition
@DEFN=Suppose a number of philosophers surround a dining table.  
Adjacent philosophers share one fork.  
They spend time thinking or trying to eat.  
A philosopher must have both the fork on the left and
the fork on the right to eat.  Clearly adjacent philosophers cannot
eat at the same
time.  The problem is to find an algorithm for taking forks that
prevents deadlock, starvation, etc.
