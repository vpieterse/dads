# the definition
@DEFN=An algorithm that always takes the best immediate, or local,
solution while finding an answer.  Greedy algorithms find
the overall, or globally, {optimal solution} for some {optimization
problems}, but may
find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.

@NOTES={Prim-Jarnik algorithm} and {Kruskal's algorithm} are greedy
algorithms that find the globally optimal solution, a {minimum
spanning tree}.  In contrast, any known greedy algorithm to find a
{Hamiltonian cycle} might not find the shortest path, that is, a solution
to the {traveling salesman} problem.

<p>
If there is no greedy algorithm that always finds the optimal
solution for a problem, one may have to search (exponentially) many
possible solutions to find the optimum.  Greedy algorithms are usually
quicker, since they don't consider the details of possible alternatives.
