@DEFN=Any {algorithm} that makes random (or pseudorandom) choices.

# Generalization: "I am a kind of ..."
@IMA={algorithm}
# Specialization: "... is a kind of me."
@VARIANT={Monte Carlo algorithm}, {Las Vegas algorithm}, 
{skip list} insert, {randomized binary search tree},
{reservoir sampling}
# Aggregate parent: "I am a part of or used in ..."
@IMIN=
# Aggregate child: "... is a part of or used in me."
@INME=
# Other cross references that don't fit the above.  printed as "See also ..."
@XREFS={adversary}, {pseudo-random number generator},
{probabilistic algorithm},
{deterministic algorithm}
