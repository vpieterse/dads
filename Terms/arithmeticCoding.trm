# the definition
@DEFN=A minimal variable-length message coding based on the
frequency of each character.  The message is represented by a
fraction which is the repeated offset-plus-product reduction of the
range (offset) and probability (product) of each character.

# any notes.  these are not printed in the final dictionary
@NOTES=Shannon-Fano is a minimal prefix code. Huffman is optimal for
character coding (one character-one code word) and simple to
program.  Arithmetic coding is even more compact, since it can
allocate fractional bits, but is more complicated and patents cover
some uses.

<p>
Range encoding is essentially the same, but uses integers and integer
ranges instead of fractions.  The implementation in
<strong>Martin</strong> 1979 is thought to not be covered by patents.
