@NOTES=A combination is a subset with exactly $m$ elements.

<p>
There are {$n!/(n-m)!m!$#factorial} combinations of $n$
(distinguishable) elements taken $m$ at a time.  Why?  To begin, there
are $n!$ {permutations}.  Permutations that only differ in the order
of the $n-m$ elements not taken are the same combination, so divide by
$(n-m)!$.  The order of the $m$ elements taken doesn't matter either,
so divide by $m!$, too.
