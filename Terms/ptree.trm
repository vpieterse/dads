# the definition
@DEFN=(1) A {spatial access method} that defines hyperplanes, in
addition to the orthogonal dimensions, which node boundaries may
parallel.  Space is split by hierarchically nested 
{polytopes} (multidimensional boxes
with nonrectangular sides).  The {R-tree} is a special case that
has no additional hyperplanes.
(2) A {spatial access method} that splits space by
hierarchically nested polytopes.
The {R-tree} is a special case in which all polytopes are boxes.
#(3) pointer tree? (see implementation)
