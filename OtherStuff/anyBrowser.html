DADS bears the "Viewable with any Browser" icon because the authors of
DADS agree with this campaign.  We are participating in this effort by
avoiding tricks that may influence the portability of this
website. We are aware that some pages may look better in some browsers than
others, but are confident all our pages are readable with the vast majority of
browsers in use.
</p>
<p>The following highlights some unavoidable problems and how we address
them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are not standardized. Most browsers are dependent on fonts
  that are globally available on the machine where the browser is
  running. Furthermore, different browsers have different heuristics
  to determine the fall-back font to use if a specified font is not
  available. We aim to achieve maximum consistency across browsers,
  we do not make extensive use of fonts. When we specify fonts, we use
  only fonts that are widely used and hence more likely to be
  available. We explicitly specify a fall-back chain of fonts down to the best
  known generic font in the font-family we prefer.
<li>Authors of websites as well as readers can specify style
  preferences. A user's style preferences my override style
  specifications for our site and style preferences that were
  specified for previously viewed sites may have an effect on how our
  site is rendered. We aim to minimize the possibility that these side
  effects have a negative impact on the viewability of our site by
  minimizing the number of styles we rely on and by resetting styles
  that we are aware of that may have a harmful impact on our site. 
</ul>
<p>If you experience any difficulty viewing any information in DADS in
your preferred way, we would like to know about it. include(`Pages/bitsFixDefn.m4')</p>

<p>The following is a list of other things we do to support the
cross-platform and cross-browser viewability of this site:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Formatting specific settings are set in a cascading style sheet. If a
  browser does not support cascading style sheets, the page will be
  rendered with default settings for all tags, which is in most cases
  the safest option.
<li>Formatting specific settings are kept to a minimum and only used
  when we have confirmation that it is supported by most browsers. A
  good reference we use for this purpose is at:
  <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css"
  traget="_blank">http://reference.sitepoint.com/css</a>
<li>We minimize the use of images. When we use images, the dimensions of
  the image is specified in pixels, an alternate text describing the
  images is included that can be displayed if for some reason the
  image is not shown. GIF format is widely supported, however, we
  refrain from using images in GIF format in support of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/server/fsf-html-style-sheet.html#UseofGraphics"
  target = "_blank">GNU
  guidelines</a>. We prefer JPEG format. It seems to be
  the most widely supported image format that has not been compromised
  by copyright issues.
<li>We minimize the use of tables. Often tables are unreadable in browsers that
  do not support tables. Instead we display tabular information as
  preformatted text using mono-spaced fonts. 
<li>We use lower case in HTML tags. Although, HTML
  is not case sensitive, XHTML requires all tags to be in
  lowercase. This improves the readability as well as the portability
  of our code.
<li>We use alphabetical characters and digits when naming our
  directories and files to minimize errors when other sites point to
  our site. We also encode reserved characters in URLs specified in
  outgoing links using their hexadecimal formats.
</ul>
